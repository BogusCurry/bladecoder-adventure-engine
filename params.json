  "body": "Bladecoder Adventure Engine\r\n===========================\r\n\r\nThe **Bladecoder Adventure Engine** is a set of tools to create interactive graphic adventures (classical point and click games).\r\n\r\nI think that this type of games are a great medium to tell stories and mobile devices provide a big opportunity to rebirth and evolve them.\r\n\r\nBy creating the **Bladecoder Adventure Engine**, I want to create a platform to tell stories. Interactive stories with modern graphics, animations and music.\r\n\r\nThe **Bladecoder Adventure Engine** is composed of the following subprojects:\r\n\r\n* **adventure-editor**: the graphical editor for creating point and click games.\r\n* **blade-engine**: the engine to run the games created with `adventure-editor`.\r\n\r\nThe **Bladecoder Adventure Engine** has been developed using the [LibGDX](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/) framework and the project generates a layout similar to any LibGDX project. This lowers the learning curve and eases development and deploy on several platforms.\r\n\r\n### Adventure Editor\r\nThe **Adventure Editor** is a graphical editor to create full point and click games with minimal programming.\r\n\r\n![adventure editor 2014-09-26](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/6229260/4420346/1d3a1b8a-4578-11e4-8eec-415f5e27c005.png)\r\n\r\n### Blade Engine\r\nThe Engine has the following features:\r\n* Multi platform support: Android, IOS, Desktop (Windows, OSX, Linux) and HTML\r\n* Several animation techniques: sprite/atlas animation, Spine (cutout) animation and 3d model animation\r\n* 3d character support\r\n* Multiresolution to deal with different densities and screen sizes\r\n* Multilanguage support\r\n\r\n### The Goddess Robbery\r\n\r\nThe **Bladecoder Adventure Engine** is currently under continuous development and it's almost ready for production. **The Goddess Robbery** is a test game created to show the features of the Engine.\r\n\r\nThe source of **The Goddess Robbery** can be downloaded  [here](https://github.com/bladecoder/bladecoder-adventure-tests/tree/master/venus) and it's useful to learn how to use the **Adventure Editor**.\r\n\r\n**The Goddess Robbery** is also available for Android devices at the Google Play Store.\r\n\r\n[![The Goddess Robbery on Google Play](http://i.imgur.com/yn6RYuX.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.bladecoder.engine)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Download latest release\r\n\r\nCheck the [release page](https://github.com/bladecoder/bladecoder-adventure-engine/releases) to download the latest version.\r\n\r\n### Building and running\r\nIn order to compile, build and run the engine, the Java platform is necessary. The project uses Gradle to build and package.\r\n\r\nBuild:\r\n\r\n    $ ./gradlew build\r\n\r\nRun the Adventure Editor:\r\n\r\n    $ ./gradlew run\r\n\r\nCreate a distribution package for the Adventure Editor:\r\n\r\n    $ ./gradlew distZip\r\n\r\nA zip package ready for distribution is created in the folder 'bladecoder-adventure-engine/adventure-editor/build/distributions'\r\n\r\n### License\r\nThe **Bladecoder Adventure Engine** is licensed under the [Apache 2 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html), meaning you\r\ncan use it free of charge, without strings attached in commercial and non-commercial projects.\r\n",
